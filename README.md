`proj.lapply` is a package in the
[`proj.verse`](https://github.com/edwardlavender/proj.verse) ecosystem.

# Installation

The [`proj.verse`](https://github.com/edwardlavender/proj.verse) family
of packages can be installed with:

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("edwardlavender/proj.verse", 
                         dependencies = TRUE)
```

# Functionality

In base `R`, the function `lapply(list, function)` is a key routine that
applies a function iteratively, returning a `list`. This is conveniently
extended by `pbapply::pblapply()` with parallelisation and a progress
bar. The core routines in this package extend `pbapply::pblapply()`.

**`cl_lapply()`** extends `pbapply::pblapply()` by:

- Handling cluster set up, implementation and closure;
- Optional chunk-wise parallelisation for improved efficiency;

**`cl_lapply_workflow()`** extends `cl_lapply()` with additional
functionality for iterative applications of more complicated workflows,
by:

- Sending user output to the console or a `log.txt` file;
- Error handling around the user-defined `function`;
- Recording call statistics (such as success and computation time);
- Optionally writing `function` outputs to disk to handle memory
  requirements;
- Implementing optional coffee breaks that give your computer a rest;
